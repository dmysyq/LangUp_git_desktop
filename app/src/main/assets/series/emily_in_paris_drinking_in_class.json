To drink whilst you're traveling to the next bar.\n\nEmily: Or French class.\n\nAlfie: You know, one thing I'll give old Paris, open container laws, I mean you can get on the lash wherever you want.\n\nEmily: I don't think that's true.\n\nAlfie: Well, I haven't been nicked yet. Maybe tonight's the night. You fancy getting banged up abroad, Cooper?\n\nEmily: You know, the more you drink, the more British you sound. Are you sure we're not too drunk for French class? Should we skip it?\n\nAlfie: Can't. Need to get my little attendance slip signed for work. Don't worry, love. We'll be hunky-dory.\n\nEmily: Hunky-dory? Oh, now you're just taking the piss. I'm a fast learner.\n\nTeacher: I hope you both find your grades as funny.\n\nTeacher: Alfie, can you join me at the board, please. So, one common mistake in the test was people using 'je suppose' instead of 'j'imagine.' They're very similar, but 'j'imagine' is more abstract.\n\nTeacher: Alfie, can you write on the board, please, 'J'imagine que je suis en vacances.'\n\nAlfie: What was the rest?\n\nTeacher: Non, pas Jean Magine. J'imagine.\n\nAlfie: Yeah, that's what I wrote.\n\nTeacher: No.\n\nAlfie: Who the hell's Jean Magine, anyway?\n\nTeacher: En francais, s'il vous plait.\n\nAlfie: Qui est Jean Magine?\n\nEmily: I imagine Alfie's doing his best. He doesn't have much opportunity to speak with many French people.\n\nAlfie: Now that was bloody brilliant! What did she say?\n\nTeacher: Emily! Well done. Tonight for the first time, you fully immersed yourself in the language. You didn't overthink it.\n\nEmily: Merci. I don't know really what came over me, but maybe it's the heatwave.\n\nTeacher: Yeah, or whatever's in that cup. Alfie, I wish I could say the same to you.\n\nAlfie: All good. Not bothered.\n\nTeacher: I didn't think so. Hmm. Bonne nuit.\n\nAlfie: She is so into me."
