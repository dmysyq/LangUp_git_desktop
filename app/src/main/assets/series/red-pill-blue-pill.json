Sit.\n\nMorpheus: You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo?\n\nNeo: No.\n\nMorpheus: Why not?\n\nNeo: Because I don’t like the idea that I’m not in control of my life.\n\nMorpheus: I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you’re here. You’re here because you know something. What you know you can’t explain, but you feel it. You’ve felt it#: your entire life. That there’s something wrong with the world. You don’t know what it is, but it’s there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I’m talking about?\n\nNeo: The Matrix?\n\nMorpheus: The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this very room. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.\n\nNeo: What truth?\n\nMorpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.\n\nMorpheus: Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.\n\nMorpheus: This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n\nMorpheus: Remember, all I’m offering is the truth, nothing more."
