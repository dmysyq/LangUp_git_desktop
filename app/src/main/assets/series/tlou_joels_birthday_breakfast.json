I swear.\n\nJoel: You know I don't really like pancakes.\n\nSarah: I know you don't like them. It was for my benefit. Vitamin C.\n\nJoel: (Did) You get your homework done? Fractions?\n\nSarah: How old are you again?\n\nJoel: Thirty-six.\n\nSarah: You are going to have to wear diapers soon.\n\nJoel: Who says I don't already? Shell.\n\nSarah: Calcium.\n\nJoel: Lovely. Is there enough for Uncle Tommy?\n\nSarah: There would've been.\n\nTommy: Ay! You're still alive, you old fucker.\n\nSarah: Aw, he loves you.\n\nJoel: He's dependent on me. It's not the same.\n\nSarah: I think it's the same.\n\nTommy: It's definitely the same. I thought we was having pancakes.\n\nJoel: We'll pick you something up on the road. Are the concrete guys going to be there?\n\nTommy: Yeah, they said maybe.\n\nJoel: Maybe? We can't frame until we pour. We're not getting paid until we frame.\n\nTommy: Well, we could bring someone else on, and get the job done faster.\n\nJoel: No, no. I'm not splitting this job. I barely want to split it with you. We could work a double.\n\nSarah: Literally? Today?\n\nJoel: I know. I'd be done by nine. By nine, right?\n\nTommy: Yeah.\n\nJoel: I'll bring back a cake. I promise.\n\nRadio: ...continued disturbances in Jakarta, but are advising U.S. citizens...\n\nJoel: Jakarta. Where is that, Middle East?\n\nTommy: It doesn't ring a bell. It's definitely a country. Or maybe part of Asia?\n\nSarah: Jakarta isn't a country. Being a part of Asia isn't mutually exclusive with being a country, and in fact, it's the capital of Indonesia.\n\nTommy: Shit. (There is) Hope for us yet.\n\nJoel: All right. Finish up quick. We'll drop you off.\n\nSarah: I'm still eating my eggshells.\n\nJoel: You got seven minutes.\n\nSarah: Your t-shirt is inside out.\n\nJoel: Shit.\n\nTommy: He's losing it.\n\nMr. Adler: Hey, neighbor!\n\nSarah: Oh, hi.\n\nMr. Adler: Uh, Connie was asking after you, since you haven't been over in a while.\n\nJoel: Make them happy.\n\nSarah: I could come by after school, but just for, like, a little bit?\n\nMr. Adler: Oh, she'll take what you got. Y'all can bake, whatever. Speaking of, we got a lot of extra here. Y'all, y'all want some biscuits?\n\nSarah: Dad, you love biscuits.\n\nJoel: I do. But I'm on Atkins.\n\nMr. Adler: On what now?\n\nJoel: It's... You know what? We (have) got to run, but Sarah will be by later. She'll stay as long as you want. (She will) Tell you all about Atkins.\n\nMr. Adler: Great! I'll let Connie know.\n\nSarah: Solid.\n\nTommy: I can't tell you how exciting it was listening to that fucking conversation.\n\nJoel: Put that out.\n\nTommy: Happy Birthday to you."
