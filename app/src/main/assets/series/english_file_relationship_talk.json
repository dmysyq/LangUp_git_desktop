You know your offer to work here came at a very good time for me.\n\nJenny: Really?\n\nRob: Yeah. I was looking for something new. Something different. You see, I broke up with my girlfriend a few months before I met you.\n\nJenny: Oh. Right.\n\nRob: What about you?\n\nJenny: What about me?\n\nRob: You know. Relationships.\n\nJenny: I've been too busy recently to think about relationships. Getting this job at the magazine was a really big thing for me. I guess that's taken up all my time and energy.\n\nRob: But that isn't very good for you. Only thinking about work, I mean.\n\nJenny: Why didn't you tell me you weren't feeling well this morning? We didn't have to go for a run.\n\nRob: I wanted to go. It was nice.\n\nJenny: Well, I'm glad you're feeling better. Would you like another coffee?\n\nRob: No thanks. I think I should get back to the hotel now. I've got a really busy day tomorrow. Do you have a telephone number for a taxi?\n\nJenny: Yeah, but it's much easier to get a cab on the street.\n\nRob: Okay then.\n\nJenny: I'll see you in the morning if you're feeling okay.\n\nRob: Oh, I'm sure I'll be fine. Thanks again for a great evening.\n\nJenny: Anytime.\n\nRob: Good night.\n\nJenny: Night Rob."
