It's the post office, where we send things via the post, not in the mail. This is a postbox, not a mailbox. We queue, we don't stand in line.\n\nNow, a very important one. That is the fish & chip shop, where we eat fish and chips, not French fries. Incidentally, what the Americans call chips, we call crisps.\n\nWhat else have we got? That is the Chinese takeaway—what an American would call Chinese takeout.\n\nThis is a bus stop. We call buses and trains public transport. In America, they're called public transportation.\n\nOoh, here's a good one. This is what we'd call an estate car, where (whereas) the Americans would call it a station wagon.\n\nLitter. Littering is a British word for dropping trash on the floor. Here's a key difference: that's a dustbin or a litter bin. It's not a trash can.\n\nThis is a phone box. It's not a phone booth. No one uses them anyway. It smells weird.\n\nThis is a pedestrian crossing. It's not a crosswalk.\n\nAnd this is probably the most important thing in the village. It's the pub, where one can get varying degrees of pissed on pints, including 'slightly sozzled' and 'totally trollied.'\n\nYum."
