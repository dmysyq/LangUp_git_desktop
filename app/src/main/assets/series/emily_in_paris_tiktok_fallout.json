You can't fake the look of love in the air.\n\nJulien: Our outdoor campaign launched today in Paris, New York, and Seoul, and we're premiering the ad on the big screen at Roland-Garros tomorrow, where we plan to host our happy couple in the AMI courtside box.\n\nGeorges: You both must be there. We want it to be interactive. The AMI couple in the flesh, and in love, and on the big screen.\n\nLuc: There is something you should see.\n\nJulien: Stop whispering. Everyone can hear you.\n\nEmily: I have an idea. If you really want it to be interactive, then why not get the whole stadium involved. Let the camera roam and find other couples in love. Like a... Like a kiss cam.\n\nGeorges: Qu'est-ce que c'est, une kiss cam?\n\nJulien: Oui, Emily. Qu'est-ce que c'est, une kiss cam?\n\nEmily: You find couples in love in the audience, and when they're on the Jumbotron, they kiss. They do it at the Cubs games.\n\nGeorges: Right, like a caméra bisous.\n\nGeorges: Oui, oui, bisou bisou for everyone. Right. It's way better than me and Alfie, you know. Yeah. You don't even need us.\n\nGeorges: Ah, non, non, non, bisou for you too. For, for the entire world.\n\nGeorges: Mm-hmm. Oui, oui, oui. Oui, Emily. The AMI campaign is about the love story between you and Alfie.\n\nGeorges: Exactement.\n\nJulien: Putain. Why didn't you say anything?\n\nEmily: I was trying not to interfere with your client, like I promised.\n\nJulien: Not interfere? You've inserted yourself into the campaign.\n\nLuc: Yes, but who could imagine things would balloon the way they did?\n\nSylvie: What happened?\n\nJulien: AMI wants her and Alfie in their box, but now their breakup is all over the Internet.\n\nSylvie: I warned you about this, Emily. You broadcast your entire life for public consumption, and now it's affecting my business.\n\nEmily: I can try to get it taken down, okay, but I don't know about Alfie. He won't even speak to me, and well, he blocked my number and deleted me on Instagram.\n\nLuc: After such a humiliation, who can blame him?\n\nSylvie: Okay, ça suffit. I have a meeting at Maison Lavaux. Fix this."
