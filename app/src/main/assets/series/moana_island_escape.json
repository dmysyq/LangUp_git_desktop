And I'm going to love you in my belly. Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.\n\nMaui: I could watch that all day. Okay. Enjoy the island. Maui, out.\n\nMoana: No! Stop! Hey!

I'm out. Oh, come on!\n\nMoana: What is your problem? Are you afraid of it?\n\nMaui: No! No. I'm not afraid. Stay out of it, or you're sleeping in my armpit. You, stop it. That is not a heart. It is a curse. The second I took it, I got blasted out of the sky and I lost my hook. Get it away from me.\n\nMoana: Get this away?\n\nMaui: Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay? Stop that. I will smite you! You want to get smote? Smotten? Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life. It's a homing beacon of death. If you don't put it away, bad things are going to come for it.\n\nMoana: Come for this? The Heart? You mean this heart right here? Come and get it!\n\nMaui: You are going to get us killed!\n\nMoana: No, I'm going to get us to Te Fiti so you can put it back. Thank you.
