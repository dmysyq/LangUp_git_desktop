Anyway, I'd look good blond.\n\nMarshall: Okay, people, we're in a delicate but very, very promising situation here.\n\nLily: If we play the next 30 seconds right, Ted will dye his hair blond.\n\nRobin: Guys, this is mean. We can't-- Wup! I just pictured it. How do we do this?\n\nTed: What are we all thinking about? Nachos?\n\nMarshall: Ted Mosby responds to one thing above all else.\n\nTed: I don't know. I'm still kind of full from lunch.\n\nMarshall: A bunch of people emphatically telling him not to do something. Follow my lead.\n\nTed: Ah, screw it, I could eat. Yes, we'd all like some nachos.\n\nMarshall: I love you, buddy, but there's absolutely no way that you could pull off blond.\n\nRobin: It just wouldn't look right.\n\nLily: Yeah, seriously, Ted, don't go blond.\n\nTed: I'm going blond!\n\nLily: No!\n\nRobin: No!\n\nMarshall: That is not the outcome we were hoping for!\n\nRobin: Hey.\n\nBarney: Hey.\n\nLily: Guys, this might be the depression talking, but is Ted's hair starting to look kind of good?\n\nMarshall: Thank God. I thought I was the only one!\n\nBarney: He looks like a freaking movie star!\n\nTed: Oh, and by the way, this was a huge mistake.
