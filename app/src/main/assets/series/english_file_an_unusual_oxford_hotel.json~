          "full": "Hi, I'm Greg. Welcome to Oxford! I'm visiting the Old Bank Hotel. It's an unusual hotel in the centre of the city.\n\nThe Old Bank is in the High Street, in the centre of Oxford. Today, it's a luxury hotel, but these buildings from number 92 to number 94 have a very interesting history.\n\nIn the 16th century, they were part of Christ Church College. In the 18th century, they were different shops. And we know that in 1808, the buildings were one business—a bank.\n\nThere was a bank here for almost 200 years, but today, it is a famous Oxford hotel. Would you like to go in and look? Let's go!\n\nThe Old Bank Hotel has a beautiful reception and a fantastic restaurant. There are 42 bedrooms, and they're all very comfortable. They have great views of Oxford's famous colleges. This room has a large bed, two chairs, a table, a television, and a cupboard. It has a beautiful marble bathroom, too.\n\nBut there are other rooms that visitors to the hotel don't usually see. These secret rooms are here in the cellar under the hotel.\n\nThese are the old bank vaults. When the hotel was a bank, all the money was here. The rooms were small, and the doors weren't easy to open. They were very, very strong, and on each one, there was a large lock.\n\nToday, these old vaults are storerooms. The hotel keeps its wine collection in here, so it's very, very safe.\n\n92 to 94 High Street is a part of Oxford's history, and today, if you want to visit Oxford, the Old Bank is a fantastic place to see."
