Yoko's hosting a mani-pedi party for her crew.\n\nWednesday: This is the third time in 24 hours you've forgotten something.\n\nEnid: So, how is everything going?\n\nWednesday: Solitude suits me. With no annoying distractions, I'm almost finished with my novel.\n\nEnid: Was I an annoying distraction?\n\nWednesday: You definitely had some annoying habits.\n\nEnid: Such as?\n\nWednesday: You giggle when you text, which is a 24/7 addiction.\n\nEnid: Well, at least it's not a migraine-inducing typewriter hammering into my head.\n\nWednesday: When not grinding your canines, you growl in your sleep.\n\nEnid: As opposed to late night cello solos?\n\nWednesday: You over-commit to clubs and activities and then complain about them nonstop.\n\nEnid: I'd take that over your obsession with all things creepy and dead.\n\nWednesday: You could gas an entire small village with the amount of perfume you spritz. And that's just off the top of my head.\n\nEnid: Guess I'm lucky with the new bestie that doesn't try to find ways to endanger literally everybody she comes into contact with. In fact, Yoko and I are so in sync that she's begging me to be her new roomie. Permanently.\n\nWednesday: Don't let me hold you back.\n\nEnid: Enjoy your solitude, Wednesday.\n\nWednesday: It's not solitude if you're still here.\n\n\nMs. Thornhill: I didn't mean to startle you.\n\nWednesday: I was just working on my novel.\n\nMs. Thornhill: Enid has requested to room with Yoko for the rest of the school year.\n\nWednesday: She did?\n\nMs. Thornhill: When there's a falling-out, I like to get both girls' perspectives on what happened. You two seemed as thick as thieves.\n\nWednesday: Ultimately, thieves turn on each other. I've seen it with my own eyes.\n\nMs. Thornhill: Deflect all you want, but you and I both know that you care about Enid. And you have to admit she managed to bring out a spark of warmth in you. Oh, don't worry. Just a tiny spark. Barely perceptible to the average eye, but I noticed. Part of the dorm experience is making friends with people that you wouldn't normally connect with. And those friendships often turn into lifelong bonds.\n\nWednesday: I would rather buy a rope.\n\nMs. Thornhill: Is it really so difficult for you to admit that you made a friend, and now that she's gone you might actually miss her?\n\nWednesday: I'll survive alone. I always have.\n\nMs. Thornhill: Well, if that's your decision, I'll submit the forms to Principal Weems."
