If you can't learn to run with the pack, one of these days you'll be someone's dinner.\n\nWolf cub: How'd we do?\n\nWolf cub: Not Mowgli, again.\n\nWolf cub: He's never going to make the Council.\n\nWolf cub: Let's go!\n\nWolf cub: Race you to the top!\n\nMowgli: It was higher ground.\n\nBagheera: Wolves don't hide in trees.\n\nMowgli: I can't keep up with them, Bagheera. I tried. I just picked the wrong tree.\n\nBagheera: It was a dead tree.\n\nMowgli: How was I supposed to know it was dead?\n\nBagheera: It had a fig vine. Any tree girdled by a creeper is either dead or close to it. These are things a wolf must know.\n\nMowgli: Yeah, but if the branch didn't break, I would've made it.\n\nBagheera: I realize you weren't born a wolf, but couldn't you at least act like one?\n\nBagheera: When I found him, many years ago, he was just an infant, abandoned in the woods.\n\nRaksha: Get the deer!\n\nBagheera: If he was going to survive, I knew he needed a people, a people to protect him. That's why I entrusted him to the wolves.\n\nAkela: Look well, wolves.\n\nBagheera: Akela was a just and noble leader. He allowed Mowgli to dwell among them all those years. The trouble was wolves grew so fast, and Mowgli, well, let's just say he liked to take his time.\n\nWolf cub: Mowgli, pick me up high!\n\nWolf cub: My turn!\n\nRaksha: Stop. Not now.\n\nBagheera: It was Raksha who raised him. She was the only mother he ever knew.\n\nWolf cub: Come on, let's play!\n\nMowgli: I don't feel like playing, Gray.\n\nWolf cub: Come on, you're my brother. You have to play with me. Let's go chase some mice.\n\nRaksha: How did it go?\n\nMowgli: Caught me again.\n\nRaksha: If it's meant to be, it will be.\n\nAkela: Let me hear the Law.\n\nWolves: This is the Law of the Jungle, as old and as true as the sky. The Wolf that keeps it will prosper, but the Wolf that breaks it will die. Like the creeper that girdles the tree trunk, the Law runneth over and back. For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack."
