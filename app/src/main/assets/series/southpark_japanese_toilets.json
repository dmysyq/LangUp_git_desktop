You've got to choose if you want to be in Gryffindor or Slytherin.\n\nStan: Yeah, can I do it?\n\nRandy: Yeah, see, you've got to fight these fairy guys.\n\nSharon: Randy. Randy! The powder room toilet is broken. Again!\n\nRandy: Did you jiggle the handle?\n\nSharon: Yes, I jiggled the handle. Will you come fix this, please?\n\nRandy: Okay, okay...\n\nRandy: Huh, well, let's see. It's got to be the little black floaty thingy. What'd you do to it?\n\nSharon: I didn't do anything.\n\nRandy: Let me see if there's water in the bowl.\n\nSharon: No! Don't lift the lid!\n\nRandy: Why can't I lift the lid?\n\nSharon: Don't, Randy!\n\nRandy: Uh-huh... Hey, guys! Your mom took a shit and doesn't want me to see it.\n\nStan: Ew!\n\nShelly: Gross, Dad!\n\nSharon: Randy! We need to get a new toilet.\n\nRandy: We can't just get rid of 'Ol Blue, Sharon.\n\nSharon: This is embarrassing. It's the powder room toilet, the one guests use. You get a new toilet, Randy, or I'm not helping you sell weed anymore!\n\nRandy: All right, all right. Sharron, you win. As usual. Poor 'Ol Blue...\n\nEmployee: Can I help you with anything?\n\nRandy: Oh, yeah, I'm just looking for a new toilet to replace Ol' Blue.\n\nEmployee: All right, well, all our toilets here are standard bowl, come with full warranty. How much are you looking to spend?\n\nRandy: Well, I'm not poor. I happen to have my own weed business. So that's pretty much the nicest one you have, right?\n\nEmployee: Yeah, that's probably the top model, you know, before you start getting into Japanese toilets.\n\nRandy: Japanese toilets?\n\nEmployee: Yeah, they're the sort of the super-high-class luxury models with all the bells and whistles. But you probably don't want to spend that kind of money.\n\nRandy: I'm not poor.\n\nEmployee: Oh, well, we can show them to you. The Japanese toilets are right over there.\n\nEmployee: Hi, Rick. This gentleman would like to see the Japanese toilets.\n\nRick: Well, of course, sir. My name is Rick. Let me know if there's anything you need.\n\nEmployee: These toilets are all equipped with the highest-end features, including an automatic bidet system, Bluetooth capability, and seat warmers.\n\nRandy: Seat warmers?\n\nEmployee: Of course. And the toilet senses when you've come into the room, turns on a small light, plays welcome music, and raises the lid for you.\n\nWaitress: Can I offer you some sparkling water or champagne?\n\nRandy: Oh, sure, I'll take some champagne.\n\nEmployee: All the toilet's functions are operated by a touch-button remote which you mount where the toilet-paper roll used to go.\n\nRandy: So then where do you keep the toilet paper?\n\nEmployee: With a Japanese toilet, you don't need toilet paper. The toilet washes you completely clean.\n\nRandy: You're mad.\n\nEmployee: No, it's true. It has warm water and a dryer and cleans you eight times better than toilet paper can. Would you like to take one for a test drive?\n\nRandy: Oh, uh, sure. I did have kind of a big breakfast.\n\nEmployee: Right over here.\n\nRandy: Oh! Whoa! Ooh. Oh, oh! Oh. Ahh! Oh, oh...\n\nRandy: Okay, how much?"
