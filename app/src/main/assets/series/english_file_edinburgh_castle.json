About four hundred thousand people live in the city, and six million people visit every year.\n\nEvery year in August, there's a festival in the city with a lot of theater, music, dance, and comedy.\n\nThe original city was built on the Royal Mile. This is a street in Edinburgh's Old Town. The Royal Mile is about 1.6 km long. It starts at Holyrood Palace and finishes at Edinburgh Castle. It is called the Royal Mile because it connects two royal homes.\n\nThe castle is nearly a thousand years old. It stands on an enormous piece of volcanic rock, and it looks down on the rest of the city.\n\nKing David the First of Scotland was the first king who built on the rock in about 1130.\n\nHe built this chapel and named it Queen Mary's Chapel after his mother.\n\nFor the next three hundred years, the castle was at the center of wars between England and Scotland.\n\nIn the 15th century, the castle became the home of the King of Scotland. Each new king added to the castle.\n\nIn 1511, James the Fourth built the Great Hall.\n\nIn the 16th century, James the Sixth added extra defenses to the castle entrance.\n\nIn the 18th century, Scotland officially became part of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe last battle at the castle was in 1745 when Prince Charles Edward Stewart, who was nicknamed 'Bonny Prince Charley', tried to capture the castle.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the castle was a prison, but it is now a tourist attraction.\n\nAbout one and a quarter million people visit the castle every year. They come to see the buildings and to hear the stories.\n\nThey also come to see and hear the one o'clock gun. Soldiers fire this every day at exactly one o'clock.\n\nBut they really come for the views of the city of Edinburgh."
