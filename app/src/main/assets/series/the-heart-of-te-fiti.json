And Te Fiti shared it with the world.\n\nBut in time, some began to seek Te Fiti's heart. They believed that they could possess it, the great power of creation would be theirs.\n\nAnd one day, the most daring of them all voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.\n\nHe was a Demigod of the wind and sea. He was a warrior. A trickster. A shapeshifter who could change form with the power of his magical fish hook. And his name was Maui.\n\nBut without her heart, Te Fiti began to crumble, giving birth to a terrible darkness.\n\nMaui tried to escape, but was confronted by another who sought the heart: Te Kā, a demon of earth and fire.\n\nMaui was struck from the sky, never to be seen again. And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti, were lost to the sea.\n\nWhere even now, 1000 years later, Te Kā and the demons of the deep still hunt for the heart, hiding in the darkness that will continue to spread, chasing away our fish, draining the life from island after island until every one of us is devoured by the bloodthirsty jaws of inescapable death!\n\nBut one day, the heart will be found by someone who would journey beyond the reef, find Maui, deliver him across the great ocean to restore Te Fiti's heart and save us all.\n\nChief Tui: Thank you, Mother, that's enough.\n\nMoana: Papa!\n\nChief Tui: No one goes outside the reef. We're safe here. There is no darkness. There are no monsters."
