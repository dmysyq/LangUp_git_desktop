That's the point.\n\nOfficer: I'm afraid we've had some complaints about you, sir.\n\nWilly: Complaints?\n\nOfficer: That you're disrupting the trade of other businesses. I'm regrettably obliged to move you on and to confiscate your earnings.\n\nWilly: Hey! What are you doing?\n\nOfficer 2: Don't worry, it's going to a good cause. Sick kids, or something.\n\nOfficer: Sorry, sir. Rules is rules.\n\nWonka: Could you at least leave me a sovereign? I need to pay for my room.\n\nOfficer: Here.\n\nWonka: Thank you.\n\nScrubitt: Evening, Mr. Wonka. How did it go?\n\nWonka: Not quite as well as I'd hoped.\n\nScrubitt: Oh, shame. But I'm afraid we do have to settle up now.\n\nWonka: Well, thankfully, the room is taken care of. I believe we said a sovereign.\n\nScrubitt: For the room, yes. But you have incurred a few extras during the course of your residency with ourselves.\n\nWonka: Have I?\n\nScrubitt: Yes, you have. There was that glass of gin you had on arrival. And if I remember rightly, you warmed your cockles by the fire.\n\nBleacher: He did indeed, Mrs. Scrubitt.\n\nScrubitt: Cocklewarming is extra, see?\n\nBleacher: He used the stairs to get to his room, and all.\n\nScrubitt: Oh, then you've got your stair charge, and that is per step, I'm afraid. Up and down. Now, tell me, Mr. Wonka, did you happen to use the minibar?\n\nWonka: There's a minibar?\n\nBleacher: Minibar of soap.\n\nScrubitt: By the sink.\n\nWonka: I might have, briefly.\n\nScrubitt: See? Even Bleacher knows you never touch the minibar, and he was raised in a ditch. Add in your mattress hire, your linen lease, and your pillow penalty, and you are looking at ten thousand sovereigns.\n\nWonka: You've got to be kidding me?\n\nScrubitt: It's all in the small print, dearie.\n\nWonka: I don't have ten thousand sovereigns.\n\nBleacher: Then we have a problem, Mr. Wonka.\n\nScrubitt: You're going have to work it off in the wash house, ain't ya? At a sovereign a day.\n\nWonka: Ten thousand days is...\n\nScrubitt: Twenty-seven years.\n\nBleacher: Four months.\n\nScrubitt: And 16 days.\n\nAbacus: Ah, you must be Mr. Wonka.\n\nWonka: Who are you?\n\nAbacus: Abacus Crunch, chartered accountant. At least, I was. Now, uh...\n\nPiper: He runs the place. And you'd best do as he says, or you'll answer to me. Piper Benz. Plumber by trade.\n\nAbacus: This is Miss Lottie Bell.\n\nMiss Bell: Hi.\n\nPiper: She don't talk much.\n\nLarry: And I'm Larry Chucklesworth! Comedian.\n\nWonka: They got all of you, too, did they?\n\nAbacus: I'm afraid so. We each of us found ourselves in need of a cheap place to stay, and neglected to read the small print.\n\nPiper: One moment of stupidity, followed by endless regret.\n\nLarry: Sounds like my third marriage. I'm sorry, I do that a lot.\n\nAbacus: He does.\n\nPiper: A lot.\n\nLarry: I've only been married once, and it didn't work out.\n\nWilly: There's got to be some way out of here.\n\nPiper: You don't think we've tried?\n\nWonka: There are bars on the window, and there's a dog on the door.\n\nAbacus: And even if you could get out, that contract is watertight.\n\nPiper: If you're not here at roll call, Mrs. Scrubitt will call the police, they'll bring you right back, and she'll charge you a thousand for the inconvenience.\n\nAbacus: All right, everybody. Back to work. Come along, Mr. Wonka. You come with me. You're in here on suds."
