What about you?\n\nTed: My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars.\n\nStella: You know, I've actually never seen Star Wars.\n\nMarshall: She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters in Star Wars, and that's because they lived them. That's because they lived the Star Wars.\n\nTed: You've got to calm down.\n\nMarshall: I told you. I told you you didn't know this girl well enough. What if you show it to her and she doesn't like it?\n\nTed: Dude, it's just a movie.\n\nMarshall: Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are.\n\nTed: Marshall, it's just a movie. It's just a movie!\n\n121 awesome minutes later...\n\nTed: Okay, if Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her.\n\nMarshall: No, you can't.\n\nTed: (Do) You want to watch it again?\n\nMarshall: Yes, I do.\n\nTed: I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.\n\nStella: It sounds like a plan.\n\nTed: Hmmmm.\n\nStella: Hey, I'm just going to grab a beer. (Do) You want one?\n\nTed: The movie's already started, so...\n\nStella: Yeah, it's just some words flying through space. I mean I'm not going to read that anyway.\n\nTed: Oh, my God.\n\nMarshall: (You're) Off to a bad start.\n\nTed: What are you doing down there?\n\nMarshall: I'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman. That's what I'm doing.\n\nTed: Dude, what the hell are you doing hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job.\n\nMarshall: I really do, don't I."
